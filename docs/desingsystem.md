# DESIGN SPECIFICATION
## MANDATE: The District Game

This document defines the complete visual, graphic, and print design system of
MANDATE: The District Game.

The goal of this design system is:
- clarity at table distance
- political abstraction without ideology
- consistency across all components
- timeless, minimal, publisher-ready aesthetics

---

## 1. CORE DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

MANDATE is an **abstract political game**, not a thematic illustration game.

Design principles:
- No characters
- No faces
- No flags
- No national symbols
- No realism

The visual language must feel:
- institutional
- modern
- calm
- authoritative

Think: **policy documents, ballots, architectural plans**, not propaganda.

---

## 2. COLOR PALETTE (FINAL)

All colors must be flat, matte, and print-safe.
