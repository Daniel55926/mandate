- the **Right**,
- and the **Independents**.

The game is not about ideology, but about **influence and decision-making power**.  
Players compete to secure **Districts** at the right moment, using the right tools.

The first player to secure **three Districts** wins a **round**.  
The game is played as a **Best of 3 (BO3)** – first to win **2 rounds** wins the game.

- Each player may place **up to 3 cards** at a District.
- A District may therefore contain **up to 9 cards** total.

---

## 6. TURN STRUCTURE

Players take turns clockwise.

Each turn consists of three steps:

### 1️⃣ Play a Card
- Play **1 card** from your hand
- To any **open District**
- On **your own side**
- As long as you have fewer than 3 cards there

### 2️⃣ Automatic Claiming
- Districts are **automatically claimed** when conditions are met:
  - **Total Mandate (AAA)** → Immediate claim
  - **2+ players completed** → District is claimed by strongest configuration

### 3️⃣ Draw a Card
- Draw **1 card** from the draw pile, if available

---

## 7. CONFIGURATIONS (COMBINATIONS)

The **three cards** you have at a District form a configuration.

### ⚖️ Strength hierarchy (from strongest to weakest):

---

### 1. **TOTAL MANDATE (AAA)**
- Three Aces
- **The strongest possible configuration**
- Overrides all others

**Example:**  
Three Aces of any colors immediately secure the District.

---

### 2. **Coordinated Strategy (Color Run)**
- Same color
- Consecutive values

**Example:**  
Blue 4 – Blue 5 – Blue 6

---

### 3. **Unified Message**
- Three identical numbers (not Aces)

**Example:**  
7 – 7 – 7 (any colors)

---

### 4. **Aligned Resources**
- Three cards of the same color
- Not consecutive

**Example:**  
Green 2 – Green 6 – Green 9

---

### 5. **Momentum**
- Consecutive numbers
- Mixed colors

**Example:**  
3 – 4 – 5

---

### 6. **Party**
- Two identical numbers (a pair) or double Ace
- In case both have a Party: stronger pair wins
- In case of same pair: kicker wins

**Example:**  
Blue 8 – Green 8 – Purple 2

---

### 7. **Raw Pressure**
- None of the above
- Strength is determined by the **sum of the three cards**

---

### Ties
If players have the same configuration type:
- For Party: compare pair value first, then kicker
- For others: the **higher total value** wins.

---

## 8. ACE (A) RULES

- An Ace is **not a number**, but a symbol.
- In runs:
  - **A–2–3** is valid
  - **9–10–A** is valid
  - An Ace may not appear in the middle of a run
  - In "raw pressure" combination, an Ace is worth 11.

---

## 9. CRISIS (WILDCARD) RULES

- When played, the player declares:
  - a color
  - and a value (**2–10**)
- A Crisis card **may not represent an Ace**
- A configuration may contain **at most one Crisis**

---

## 10. CLAIMING A DISTRICT

Districts are **automatically claimed** when:

- **At least two players** have completed configurations (3 cards each)  
**OR**
- Any player has played a **Total Mandate (AAA)**

### Resolution:
- The strongest configuration wins the District
- The District is **claimed and closed**
- No further cards may be played there
- The turn continues automatically

---

## 11. WINNING A ROUND

> The first player to claim **three Districts** wins the **round**.

---

## 12. BEST OF 3 (BO3) FORMAT

### Round Structure:
- **Round 1:** Independents start first
- **Round 2:** Left starts first  
- **Round 3:** Right starts first

### Winning the Game:
- First player to win **2 rounds** wins the game
- If all 3 players win 1 round each (1-1-1) → **Tiebreaker**

### Tiebreaker Order:
1. **Total Districts won** across all 3 rounds (highest wins)
2. **Best Configuration achieved** (Total Mandate > Color Run > etc.)

---

## 13. EXAMPLE PLAY

- The Left builds a blue 9–10–A color run at a District.
- The Right completes a Unified Message (7–7–7).
